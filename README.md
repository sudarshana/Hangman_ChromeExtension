# Hangman_ChromeExtension

A simple Hangman game as a Chrome extension

The source code consists of four files working together to create a Hangman game as a browser extension. 

1. The **HTML file** defines the structure of the game interface, including placeholders for the hidden word, input fields for letter and word guesses, a list for displaying guessed letters, and buttons for submitting guesses and resetting the game.
2. The **CSS file** styles the layout and appearance of the game elements, making the user interface visually appealing. 
3. The **JavaScript file** drives the game logic, allowing players to guess letters and words while updating the interface based on correct and incorrect guesses. It fetches words from an external API, chooses a random word, handles user interactions, displays messages, and manages the game's state. Additionally, it dynamically updates the interface to reveal guessed letters and the hidden word, providing feedback when a player wins or loses.
4. The **Manifest file** defines the configuration for the browser extension, specifying its name, version, description, and permissions required.
